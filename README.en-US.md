# evil CSDN
fuck CSDN

Bullshit things CSDN did

1. Reproduction without authorized by source author: CSDN has illegally reproduced a large number of blog articles and technical materials without permission, and has not provided proper attribution or links.
2. Subscription-based reading: Without authorization, CSDN set others' original content as paid reading on its platform, and crawled free materials to CSDN and then set them as download by points.
3. Privacy issues: During the registration and use of CSDN， a large number of spam emails were received， raising suspicion that CSDN might have data leakage or improper use of user information.
4. Pollution of Chinese search： When using Chinese search engines to search for questions， a large amount of paid and low-quality content from CSDN occupies the top positions of the search results， affecting information acquisition.
5. Gitcode plagiarism： Without authorization， a large number of GitHub codes were crawled to Gitcode， and all links of CSDN were replaced with Gitcode links. 

In conclusion, and CSDN fuck you.

CSDN is a bullshit.
CSDN is a copyer.
